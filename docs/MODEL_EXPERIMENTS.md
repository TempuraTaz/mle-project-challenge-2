### Key Metrics Explained

- **Test R²**: Percentage of price variance explained by the model (higher is better)
- **RMSE**: Root Mean Squared Error in dollars (penalizes large errors heavily)
- **MAE**: Mean Absolute Error in dollars (average prediction error)
- **MAPE**: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (% error relative to price)
- **Train-Test Gap**: Measure of overfitting (< 0.10 is good generalization)

**Script:** `scripts/create_model_v3.py`, `scripts/evaluate_model_v3.py`

---

### V4: Feature Selection (80/20 Rule)

**Objective:** Validate Pareto principle - do 20% of features drive 80% of performance?

**Changes from V3:**
- Features: 43 → **12 features** (top importance from V3 analysis)

### V5: XGBoost with Hyperparameter Tuning

**Objective:** Achieve maximum performance with gradient boosting

**Changes from V3:**
- Algorithm: Random Forest → **XGBoost** (gradient boosting)
- Features: Same 18 (43 total) as V3
- Extensive hyperparameter tuning to reduce overfitting

**Initial Configuration (pre-tuning):**
```python
XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=500,
    max_depth=8,
    learning_rate=0.05,
    subsample=0.8,
    colsample_bytree=0.8,
    reg_alpha=0.1,
    reg_lambda=1.0,
    min_child_weight=3,
    gamma=0.1
)
```
- **Result:** Test R² = 0.889, Gap = 0.101 (borderline overfitting)

**Tuned Configuration (final):**
```python
XGBRegressor(
    n_estimators=300,        # Reduced from 500
    max_depth=6,             # Reduced from 8 (simpler trees)
    learning_rate=0.05,      # Kept same
    subsample=0.7,           # Reduced from 0.8 (more randomness)
    colsample_bytree=0.6,    # Reduced from 0.8 (more diversity)
    reg_alpha=0.5,           # Increased from 0.1 (stronger L1)
    reg_lambda=3.0,          # Increased from 1.0 (stronger L2)
    min_child_weight=5,      # Increased from 3 (larger leaves)
    gamma=0.3                # Increased from 0.1 (harder to split)
)
```

**Tuning Strategy:**
- Reduced model complexity (depth, trees)
- Increased regularization (L1, L2)
- More aggressive sampling (rows, columns)
- Goal: Reduce overfitting while maintaining performance

**Results:**
- Test R²: **0.881** (best test performance) ✅
- Test RMSE: **$133,505** (best error metrics)
- Test MAE: **$67,444**
- MAPE: **12.5%**
- Train-Test Gap: **0.074** (reduced from 0.101, good generalization)

**Comparison: Pre-tuning vs Post-tuning:**
- Gap: 0.101 → 0.074 (**27% reduction** in overfitting)
- Test R²: 0.889 → 0.881 (0.8% loss, acceptable trade-off)

**Insights:**
- **Best test performance** across all models
- XGBoost captures feature interactions better than RF
- Hyperparameter tuning critical for generalization
- Gradient boosting > ensemble averaging for this dataset

**Script:** `scripts/create_model_v5.py`, `scripts/evaluate_model_v5.py`

- **Living space is #4** (9.4%) - important but less dominant than in Random Forest
- **Waterfront property** (7.3%) - high-value feature, 6th most important
- **Top 10 features explain 79.8%** - concentrated prediction power
- **Top 12 features explain 83.6%** of predictions (80/20 rule validated)
- **Location coordinates** (`lat` + `long`) contribute 2.6% - micro-location effects
- **29 features have <1% importance** - significant opportunity for model simplification

### XGBoost vs Random Forest Differences

XGBoost values features differently than Random Forest:
- **Demographics are emphasized**: 48.8% of total importance in XGBoost - neighborhood effects strongly captured
- **grade becomes #1**: Build quality interactions captured more effectively (17.9% importance)
- **waterfront enters top 10**: Binary features weighted more appropriately (7.3% importance)

## Key Learnings

### 1. Algorithm Selection Matters (+8% R²)
- Random Forest > KNN for real estate (non-linear relationships)
- XGBoost > Random Forest for tabular data (captures interactions)
- Lesson: Start simple, benchmark, then escalate complexity

### 2. Feature Engineering is High-ROI (+10% R²)
- `grade` (build quality) and location are critical
- More features ≠ always better (curse of dimensionality for KNN)
- Domain knowledge helps (knowing waterfront/view matter)

### 3. 80/20 Rule Applies
- 12 features retain 99% of performance
- Production trade-off: simplicity vs 1% accuracy
- Feature importance analysis is essential

### 4. Hyperparameter Tuning Matters
- XGBoost pre-tuning: R² 0.889, gap 0.101
- XGBoost post-tuning: R² 0.881, gap 0.074
- Regularization prevents overfitting without killing performance

### 5. Real Estate Pricing Has Limits
- Best model: 88.1% R² (11.9% unexplained)
- Remaining variance likely due to:
  - Missing features (school quality, curb appeal)
  - Buyer emotions and negotiation
  - Market timing and bidding wars
  - Irreducible randomness
- 95% R² would require external data (costly, complex)
